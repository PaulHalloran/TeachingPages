This module aims to provide you with fundamental understanding of each of the major components of our contemporary Earth System, and how these components link together, allowing you to begin exploring the response of our planet to the anthropogenic pressures it is likely to experience over the coming decades. This module will provide you with a mechanistic understanding of the Geosphere, Biosphere, Cryosphere, Ocean and Atmosphere and appreciation of how these fit into the broader Earth System. By doing so, this module will deliver much of the background required for a
          degree in Physical Geography.</p></div>

              <p>
                <b>Paul is the convenor for this module and your first point of contact if you have any general questions.</b> He teaches the ocean and atmosphere components of the module.
                <br>
                <br>
                Paul's research focuses on the role of the ocean within the Earth System. His recent work has examined how the ocean <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2019GB006186" target="_blank"> takes up carbon</a>,
                how <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57472-2" target="_blank">ocean variability influences the climate</a> and how climate change may impact coral reefs.
                Paul's degree and PhD were in the Department of Earth Sciences in Oxford, where he explored El Ni&ntildeo/Le Ni&ntildea change over the Pliocene, developed novel geochemical climate proxy techniques,
                and investigated the impact of ocean acidification on calcifying phytoplankton. After his PhD Paul moved to the Met Office Hadley Centre to work on climate modelling with a focus on ocean biology and carbon.

                    Steven's research uses satellite and airborne remote sensing techniques to quantify changes in the form and flow of ice sheets and glaciers, from the Polar Regions to the Himalayas. Steven studied Earth and Space Science at University College London before moving to Cranfield University to study for a MSc in Astronautics and Space Engineering. He then worked as Mission Systems Engineer in the Earth Observation group of EADS Astrium (now Airbus) before briefly joining the British Antarctic Survey. In 2006 Steven started a PhD at the University of Edinburgh, where he used satellite radar measurements to investigate changes in the flow dynamics of glaciers in Greenland and Iceland. Following this, he spent 3 months in Antarctica conducting fieldwork on the Larsen-C ice shelf as part of a project investigating ice shelf instability. Steven then moved to the University of Leeds, where his work aimed to reduce uncertainties in the future contribution of the ice sheets to global sea level change. Before joining the University of Exeter in 2013, Steven participated in a NERC-funded airborne geophysical survey of Greenland outlet glaciers, during which time he was based at the Scott Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge. Most recently, he led a Royal Society funded
                      project to study debris-covered glaciers in the Khumbu region of Nepal

                <br>
                <br>
                Toby's research has aimed to address one of the fundamental questions of tropical biology, how and when did the huge species numbers in the tropics arise?
                It is grounded in fundamental, descriptive taxonomic, inventory and phylogenetic research, which provides the foundation to address evolutionary and biogeographic questions.
                In recent years he has focused more of his work on outcomes relevant to conservation and sustainable livelihoods in tropical Latin America.
                He has particular interest in raising the profile of neglected but highly threatened tropical dry forest and savanna biomes.
                Toby is Professor of Tropical Plant Diversity and Biogeography at the University of Exeter.
                He also retains a part time position at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh where he worked since his PhD and was Head of the Tropical Diversity section (http://www.rbge.org.uk/science/tropical-diversity) until 2017.

          <p>Each of the 'spheres' of the module will be split into topics.
          These topics will be delivered through a set of short video presentations and tied together with a live online recap and Q&A session towards the end of each week (see your timetable for exact times and dates).
          The material for each topic will be curated on the <a href="https://vle.exeter.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=9291"  target="_blank">ELE page</a> under the link for that week.
          It is important that wherever possible you work through the set material for that week before each live online session.</p>

      <h1>Module Examination</h1>
        <p>This module is unusual within your degree course in that it is assessed with a multiple choice exam.
          <br>
          <br>
          The multiple choice exam allows us to thoroughly assess your knowledge across the range of academic material which underpin the rest of your degree course,
          and avoids any temptation to gloss over topics which you might find challenging in the hope that they will not come up in the exam.
          <br>
          <br>
          The exam questions will pull from the knowledge we have delivered directly to you,
          but in accordance with the <a href="https://geography.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/schoolofgeography/pdfs/currentstudents/ug/GMS.pdf" target="_blank">mark scheme</a>, also from additional reading.
          We will go through example exam questions as part of the module teaching, and also make past exam papers available on the <a href="https://vle.exeter.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=9291"  target="_blank">ELE page</a>.

        <p>This component of the module begins by looking at the place of the ocean and atmosphere within the Earth System.
          We then develop a robust understanding of the greenhouse effect and other anthropogenic drivers of change in the Earth System,
          before getting into the processes that control the movement of the ocean and atmosphere,
          and how through the transport of energy and chemistry this impacts us, and drives the different components of the Earth System.
